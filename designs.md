# Overview

The wearable device is centred around a collection of behaviours designed by and for Families of children with Autism.

## Behaviours

The following behaviours are in-scope for the device, corresponding with the priority behaviours of three different families we are working with.

* Attention Alert
	- Design Brief
		- Subtle wearable devices allow trusted friends and family members to remotely trigger an attention getting audio-behaviour for the child with autism
	- Features
        - Multiple devices are wirelessly networked together
        - Child with autism has bluetooth audio headset hidden beneath long hair
        - Attention-getting is triggered on one device, to alert select other devices
        - Alerted devices trigger a distinctive attention-getting sound in the in-ear bluetooth earphone
	- Further Co-Design questions 
        - Interaction to trigger alert?
        - Feedback for alerter?
        - Sound behaviours for alertee?
        - Deactivation sequence?

    -  Further Co-Design questions
        - How is message recording started and finished?
        - How is message playback started and finished?
